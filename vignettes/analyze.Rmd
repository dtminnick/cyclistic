## Context

This notebook documents part of a data analysis I completed in the capstone experience for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate program on Coursera.

You can find the Github repository for my work [here](https://github.com/dtminnick/cyclistic).

## Analyze Phase

This phase involves formatting and transforming data, identifying patterns, drawing conclusions and making data-driven decisions.
