## Context

This notebook documents part of a data analysis I completed in the capstone experience for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate program on Coursera.

You can find the Github repository for my work [here](https://github.com/dtminnick/cyclistic).

## Share Phase

This phase involves creating effective visuals to bring the data to life and leveraging storytelling to communicate the results of analysis to others.
